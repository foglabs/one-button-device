ti capacitor pdf:
"In many audio applications such as analog filter design, the preferred solution is to use C0G/NP0 ceramic capaci-tors because they have much better performance and are still available in small packages. While this is a great solu-tion, it is not always feasible. In audio signal chains, keeping resistances low minimizes noise, but doing so requires increased capacitance for a given cutoff frequency. C0G/NP0 capacitors are not easily found in values greater than 1 μF, so they have limited utility in AC-coupling and other high-pass filter applications"


lo lo resistance for audio filter circuit for less noise
so higher capac

measurements

audio hole
  27mm( or whatev) from corner
  14mm from top edge

display hole
  24mm hole

  21mm fr long edge
  35mm fr short edge

arcade hole
  24mm hole

  XXX32mm fr long edge
    TOO CLOSE to display shield

  25mm fr long edge

  35mm fr short edge

rotary
  1 large drill hole
  32mm from short edge

  4 small drill holes  
  2 on mounting holes
  2 more 22mm straight across pcb

  black acrylic underneath
    snug up against display acrylic, then drill 4 holes


3 10mm switches

  3 large drill holes
    16mm,
    32mm,
    48mm from short edge
    XXX32mm from long edge
      will be 25mm due to arcade move






  add
    breautymode

    hold+tap mode to set tempo in ARPMODE

  
standardplus?
  its the mode == beautymode
    works when same num statements but
      == false
      == 'poop'

    works with two copies of == REPEATMODE

    code doesnt mater
    


arpmode with LONG_ENV is too long!
  add custom env settings for arpmode
  proably for all other modes as well





88 beats / minute = tempo



x/60000 = 88
x/1 = 88


60 * 1 / (now-m)


shitty build
----
cut acrylic cresecent out with big circle drill
cut big circle drill hole at top of 24mm arcade hole
bore out switch holes with big drill
check power and audio holes

solder
  audio jack
  3 green switches
  





qa rotary changing and effects
  notes dont seem to go down or up as much asy oure turning
  tweak long envelope, too much attack
  



*exiting tempo mode -> block mode change for 3s
*lower tempo mode hold time
*show rotary change on display

hold arcade AND rb to enter lpfChange mode....


prob with SQWANCHY bad mode, all modes get borked...
  

overlapping notes on ARPMODE long env
  need to 
  yay fixed it bad delay times



still getting hell noise on top of regnote mode and arpmode
  when holding for a long time
  fixed, bad envelope times/using noteon(reset=true)

probably weirdmode is where things get fucked up?
  nope


weirdmode
  just doesnt really work


repeatmode goes bad when you change notes
  works otherwise









major code spots
  setup_mode
    resets and state needed to start mode

  button_state == true
    start to play for various modes

  button_state == false
    stop playing for various modes

  updatecontrol
    toggle settings, read button

  updateaudio
    keep pulling signal for this mode







maybe do counter of how many semitones when knob up or down

need to
  *adjust lpf
  *adjust volume

*selecting lpf option (yellow) works once, then not again



hold to enter SELECTOPTIONMODE
  r b y ring, select menu
  go into tempomode
  go into filtermode
  etc


freezez after a bunch of rotary moves
  screen turns off

  related to screen operation -> doesnt happen with pix disabled

  rotary display!
    tuned it off, woo good result





build list
24mm arcade button

pick key etc ARPMODE
  same way as chordschema

sweepmode broken?

more inst sounds? / recolor them

show repeat mode different

lower hard lowpass freq?
  on production model
any sort of amplifier or anything?

*does delay actually do anything?
  it do now
*rotary display sometimes seems to show wrong way (or is locking bad?)
  stricter rotation logic => less illegal moves

name
*change regnotemode/etc color to more distinctive

note length optiotn?

small uf cap decoupling jewel
  to lose hi freq noise
repeatmode broken or what?
fix sweepmode envelope
  think I did?



KURE-MAN
Xenophone


sounds like shit
  audible click every time pixel is updated
    put 1000uF cap across jewels power pins
    no change
    470 resistor - no discernble change - code?

  
  higher control rate seems to cause problems?
    maybe not

clearing/setting pixel too many times was increasing..
  pixdealy of 32 seems to fit in reasonably well with audio

  +++ try out lower cutoff in hard lpf 



*-rotary in arp mode keeps you within scale instead of reg transpose
*-regnote mode knob changes reflected instantly


-store config settings in progmem
