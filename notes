ti capacitor pdf:
"In many audio applications such as analog filter design, the preferred solution is to use C0G/NP0 ceramic capaci-tors because they have much better performance and are still available in small packages. While this is a great solu-tion, it is not always feasible. In audio signal chains, keeping resistances low minimizes noise, but doing so requires increased capacitance for a given cutoff frequency. C0G/NP0 capacitors are not easily found in values greater than 1 Î¼F, so they have limited utility in AC-coupling and other high-pass filter applications"


lo lo resistance for audio filter circuit for less noise
so higher capac

measurements

audio hole
  27mm( or whatev) from corner
  22mm from top edge

display hole
  24mm hole

  21mm fr long edge
  35mm fr short edge

arcade hole
  24mm hole

  32mm fr long edge
  35mm fr short edge

rotary
  1 large drill hole
  32mm from short edge

  4 small drill holes  
  2 on mounting holes
  2 more 22mm straight across pcb

  black acrylic underneath
    snug up against display acrylic, then drill 4 holes


3 10mm switches

  3 large drill holes
    16mm,
    32mm,
    48mm from short edge
    32mm from long edge







  add
    breautymode

    hold+tap mode to set tempo in ARPMODE

  
standardplus?
  its the mode == beautymode
    works when same num statements but
      == false
      == 'poop'

    works with two copies of == REPEATMODE

    code doesnt mater
    


arpmode with LONG_ENV is too long!
  add custom env settings for arpmode
  proably for all other modes as well





88 beats / minute = tempo



x/60000 = 88
x/1 = 88


60 * 1 / (now-m)


shitty build
----
cut acrylic cresecent out with big circle drill
cut big circle drill hole at top of 24mm arcade hole
bore out switch holes with big drill
check power and audio holes

solder
  audio jack
  3 green switches
  





qa rotary changing and effects
  notes dont seem to go down or up as much asy oure turning
  tweak long envelope, too much attack
  



*exiting tempo mode -> block mode change for 3s
*lower tempo mode hold time
*show rotary change on display

hold arcade AND rb to enter lpfChange mode....


prob with SQWANCHY bad mode, all modes get borked...
  

overlapping notes on ARPMODE long env
  need to 
  yay fixed it bad delay times



still getting hell noise on top of regnote mode and arpmode
  when holding for a long time
  mostly fix


probably weirdmode is where things get fucked up?
  nope



weirdmode
