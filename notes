ti capacitor pdf:
"In many audio applications such as analog filter design, the preferred solution is to use C0G/NP0 ceramic capaci-tors because they have much better performance and are still available in small packages. While this is a great solu-tion, it is not always feasible. In audio signal chains, keeping resistances low minimizes noise, but doing so requires increased capacitance for a given cutoff frequency. C0G/NP0 capacitors are not easily found in values greater than 1 Î¼F, so they have limited utility in AC-coupling and other high-pass filter applications"


lo lo resistance for audio filter circuit for less noise
so higher capac

  4 small drill holes  
  2 on mounting holes
  2 more 22mm straight across pcb

  black acrylic underneath
    snug up against display acrylic, then drill 4 holes


3 10mm switches

  3 large drill holes
    16mm,
    32mm,
    48mm from short edge
    32mm from long edge







  add
    breautymode

    hold+tap mode to set tempo in ARPMODE

  
standardplus?
  its the mode == beautymode
    works when same num statements but
      == false
      == 'poop'

    works with two copies of == REPEATMODE

    code doesnt mater
    


arpmode with LONG_ENV is too long!
  add custom env settings for arpmode
